> Parking Finder app is a revolutionary solution to reinvent the parking experience. It is more than just another navigation app; it allows you to access your parking lot on the go using the pre-reservation feature among many others.
>
> Features include Google Maps-powered guidance to find a car park, as well as providing detailed, live information around hours and availability, directions and distance. While using a network of installed sensors we can allow access to each lot our sensors are installed in.

### User Stories

- As a user, I want to search fo the nearest parkings, so that I am aware of the distance and duration
- As a user, I want to display each parking, so that I can choose the one that have available spots
- As a user, I want to reserve a parking lot on the go, so that I can secure myself a spot

### Owner Stories

- As an owner, I want to submit a form to become a partner, so that I can have my parking available on the platform

### Admin Stories

- As an admin, I want to review, accept, and decline requests sent from owners, so that I can ensure the best quality and experience for the users
- As an admin, I want to review analytics and statistics based on real time collected data, so that I can keep track of changes and updates
- As an admin, I want to have an overview picture about users experience, so that I can plan, take decisions based on data and statistics

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
