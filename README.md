> The Well app is a mental health and mindfulness app built on top of the science of positive psychology. The Well app is more than just another meditation or journaling app; it encourages you to enhance and reflect on your day with structured, guided activities.
> 
> There are 5 daily tasks that the Well app asks you to complete each day: record 3 gratitudes, write a journal entry, perform 3 acts of kindness, exercise for 20 minutes, and meditate for 15 minutes.

Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - 🚨 Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
